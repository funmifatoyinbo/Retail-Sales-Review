And sales dropped down from the beginning of the year January - August and in December the company also  faced with sales dropped down.

- In 12months the company only make sales for 4months and face a major drop down in sales for 8months

- United Kingdom as the highest sales patronage 
 the retail store top 10 best customers excluding United Kingdom.

## Recommendations 
- Invest in marketing and promotion during the peak sales season  to maximize more revenue 

- Same strategic measure that was put in place during the company's peak sales period should also be implemented for other months so it can boost the company's revenue 

- It will be profitable if the company invest in more marketing, awareness and promotions in countries that has lower patronage in order to boost revenue than expanding to other locations for now.

- Focus on expanding and investing more in Netherlands as they got the highest value measuring from the  quantities demanded
